    aboutme: "Born in Latvia, I did not get my first computer untill the age of 14. Sharing family computer became a thing of the past, and so did the outside world. Starting with static websites, light hacking and minecraft server hosting, I expanded my knowledge of the inner workings of many systems. Faced with the harsh reality of life after finishing school, I began self learning programming. Starting with python, I slowly built up the skill to start creating projects for others on UpWork. After a company hiring me from a UpWork job, I began expanding my skillset in the real world, by working on and developing solutions. Currently between jobs, I am on a self-improvement journey, and quest to build my own product platform.",
